Original:
ax25beacon - Created by Philip Heron <phil@sanslogic.co.uk>

This simple command line program generates the audio tones for an
AX.25 packet for use on the APRS network. It encodes position, altitude
and an optional comment field.

INSTALLING

Run the following commands in the source folder to build and install ax25beacon:

make
make install

Requires the libao development files to be installed.

Revised:

This is a simple change to make it more easily used in an embedded project or 
as a simple drop in library to generate the audio.

Usage:
ax25Beacon(void *userData, audio_callback_t callback, char *src_callsign, char *dst_callsign,
           char *path1, char *path2, double latitude, double longitude, double altitude, 
	   char *comment, char sym_table, char sym_code);

audio_callback will be called when the audio is genereated.

Documentation will be in code.
